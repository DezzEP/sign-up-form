# sign-up-form

A mock up for a sign up form.
Practicing my SCSS
This was mostly done using flexbox.

The biggest challenge for this project was trying to make the image responsive and styling the text inputs.
I especially found it hard to have the text inputs stay in rows of 2, this is why you can see they don't grow or shrink
unless a media query is called.
